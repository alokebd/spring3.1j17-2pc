#Springboot two phases commit transactions demo.
Note: In a distributed system, transactions involve altering data on multiple databases or resource managers, 
causing the processing to be more complicated since the database has to coordinate the committing or rolling 
back of changes in a transaction as a self-contained unit; either the entire transaction commits or the entire 
transaction rolls back.
The Saga pattern is a sequence of local transactions in which each transaction modifies data within a single 
service. Unlike 2PC, which waits for all nodes to be ready to commit or rollback before performing the action.
